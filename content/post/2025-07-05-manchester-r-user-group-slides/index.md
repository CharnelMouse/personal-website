I gave a short talk on the autodb package to [the Manchester R user group](https://www.meetup.com/Manchester-R/) [a few days ago](https://www.meetup.com/manchester-r/events/303730429/).
The slides are now available [here](../../slides/2025-07-03-mancr/2025-07-03-mancr.html), or from [the autodb project page](../../project/autodb).

The talk seemed to go down well, and I got a few questions and conversations afterwards.
The Manchester R user group is in a good place, with a reliably good turnout: it's been managed by [Datacove](https://datacove.co.uk/) for the last three years, and is in good hands.
If you're near Manchester and interested in the language, do give it a look.

The other talk was given by [Russ Hyde from Jumping Rivers](https://www.jumpingrivers.com/authors/russ-hyde/),
on various ways to organise Shiny code into layers,
and prevent it from becoming a [big ball of mud](http://www.laputan.org/mud/mud.html).
I've only written a Shiny application once, as a mock-up, and it looked to be very easy to write yourself into a complete mess, so definitely something worth thinking about.
