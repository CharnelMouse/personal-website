Former Statistics postgraduate at University of Leeds (UK), now a Data Scientist at [Visformatics](https://www.visformatics.net/). My current work is under wraps, but I aim to make this site a portfolio for older work and side projects. It's currently under construction. I'm planning to migrate over my posts on my old blog. In the meantime, you can see them at the old Probability and Statistics blog, [The Accidental Statistician](https://accidentalstatistician.wordpress.com/).

Former posts:

- Research Associate in Modelling, working in the department of Health Economics and Decision Modelling at the University of Sheffield.
- Postdoctoral research fellow in Statistics,working on statistical modelling and calibration at the University of Leeds.
- Postgraduate research student in Statistics, working on Monte Carlo Methods, at the University of Leeds.
